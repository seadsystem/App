Some questions to address later:
- Do we need a billings page? This is a service and I suppose we want to bill people some amount every month instead of them simply buying the product. I don't know what the Seads model is. Will we need to integrate Stripe into the site, for example? Or some automatic billing?
- I know how to use SendGrid in Ruby on Rails and in ASP, maybe I can integrate it into Django. It is used for sending automatic emails, such as a welcome email when a user registers. Fun to see it actually send! This can be a stretch goal though.
- Will users of the new design understand that a red background to signifies disconnection and a green background to signifies connection? I think we should do paper prototype testing with people not in Seads before implementing this. I have a small worry they will think it is just a background decoration.. 
- We need to really launch this feedback phase with real people. It is still early enough to change design decisions.
